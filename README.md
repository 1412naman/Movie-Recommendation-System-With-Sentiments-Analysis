# Movie-Recommendation-System-With-Sentiments-Analysis

Discover personalized movie suggestions using sentiment analysis! Our user-friendly system recommends films aligned with your emotions and preferences. üé¨üçø
The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using beautifulsoup4 and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.

# Similarity Score :
How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here come the similarity scores.

It is a numerical value that ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained by measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.

# How does Cosine Similarity work?
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, the higher the cosine similarity.
